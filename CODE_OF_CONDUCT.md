# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for participation in the AÉRA project. By participating, you agree to abide by these principles and procedures.

## Purpose

We want AÉRA to be a welcoming, respectful, and productive environment for everyone — contributors, maintainers, and users. This document defines our core values, project norms, technical standards, and how we handle conflicts.

---

## 1. Core Values

- **Transparency:** If you are stuck or cannot finish a task, say it immediately. It is better to ask for help early than to block the team late.
- **Respect:** We critique code, not people. All feedback in Code Reviews must be constructive.
- **Reliability:** We commit to the tasks we take. "Ghosting" (disappearing without notice) is a serious breach of this agreement.

---

## 2. Project Management & Organization

- **Methodology:** We use an Agile workflow on GitHub Projects.
- **Sprints:** We work in **1-week sprints**.
- **Daily Meeting:** Every **Day at 10:30**
  - _Agenda:_ Demo of finished tasks, retro of the week, assignment of new tasks.
  - _Attendance:_ Mandatory. Absence must be notified 24h in advance.
- **Updates:** We regularly send updates in the group chat about the progress of our tasks.

> If you cannot attend or meet a deadline, update the ticket and inform the team as soon as possible.

---

## 3. Technical Standards (The "Architect" Rule)

- **Language:** All code, comments, variables, and commits are in **English**.
- **Linter:** No code is pushed if the linter (ESLint/Prettier) fails.
- **Documentation:** Every new Service or Controller must have a corresponding Swagger/Scalar decorator. The README must be updated if setup steps change.
- **No "Spaghetti":** Logic belongs in Services, not Controllers. UI components must be reusable.

This ensures consistency, maintainability, and easier onboardings.

---

## 4. Git Workflow & Version Control

- **Branching Strategy:** We follow Gitflow principles:
  - `main`: Production-ready (only updated via PR).
  - `dev`: Integration branch (always stable).
  - `feat/branch-name`: New features.
  - `fix/name`: Bug fixes.
- **Commit Convention:** We follow **Conventional Commits**. Examples:
  - `feat(auth): add google oauth`
  - `fix(login): resolve crash on login`
  - `docs: update readme`
- **Pull Requests (PR):**
  - **No direct pushes** to `main` or `dev`.
  - A PR requires **at least 2 approvals** from other teammates to be merged.
  - The CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) must pass (Build + Lint).

Include a clear description, testing steps, and a checklist in every PR.

---

## 5. Conflict Resolution

If a disagreement or technical deadlock arises, follow this process:

1. **Discussion:** Organize a synchronous call to discuss pros/cons.
2. **Vote:** If no consensus is reached, the team votes. Majority wins.
3. **Performance Issues:** If a member consistently misses deadlines or ghosts:
   - _Step 1:_ Private 1-on-1 check-in to understand blockers.
   - _Step 2:_ Team meeting to re-assign workload.
   - _Step 3:_ If behavior continues, escalate to the pedagogical team or project leads.

The goal is to resolve issues respectfully and quickly while supporting team members.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the maintainers. You can:

- Open a private issue titled `CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REPORT` and set the issue visibility to only repository maintainers; or
- Contact the repository owner(s) or project leads directly in private channels.

Reports will be handled confidentially. Maintainers will investigate and may take actions ranging from a private warning to removal from the project depending on the severity.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct draws on common community standards and is intended to keep the AÉRA project inclusive and productive for contributors of all backgrounds.

By participating in this project, you agree to respect these guidelines and help maintain a positive, collaborative community.
